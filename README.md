# **Iris Classification Web App** ðŸŒ¼

## **Project Description**  
This project is a **Flask-based web application** that utilizes **Machine Learning** to classify **Iris flowers**.  
Users can input flower features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width), and the application will predict the Iris species based on a trained **classification model**.

## **Technologies Used**  
- Python (Flask, NumPy, Pandas, Pickle)  
- Bootstrap 5.3  
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning Model)  

## **Installation**  
Make sure you have **Python** installed. Then, run the following command to install dependencies:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## **How to Run the Application**  
1. Clone this repository to your computer:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iseptianto/deploy-iris.git
   cd repository
   ```
2. Run the application using the following command:  
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
3. Open your browser and access **http://127.0.0.1:5000/** to start using the application.

## **Application Usage**  
- Enter the **sepal length and width** as well as the **petal length and width** in **centimeters**.  
- Click the **"Predict"** button to obtain the classification result for the Iris species.
